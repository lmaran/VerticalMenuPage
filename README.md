VerticalMenuPage
================
[Live demo.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43065769/Dev/VerticalMenuPage/index.html "Online demo")
Based on an idea stolen from [StartBootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/simple-sidebar).

## Features ##

All original features were preserved:

 - off canvas, full height, vertical menu
 - responsive design 

...and also added:

 - expand/colapse buttons
 - auto-close menu for 'small' screens (when click in menu)
 - no horizontal scrollbar when the menu is manually expanded
 - sticky header

All in pure HTML, CSS, JS (no JQuery dependency).

A remark: 
For simplicyty, I've putted together all parts (HTML, CSS, JS) in the `index.html` file so that you can access them via 'View Source' on [live demo.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43065769/Dev/VerticalMenuPage/index.html "Online demo").
